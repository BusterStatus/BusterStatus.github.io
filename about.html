            Full stack web developer with a passion for solving challenges using the latest web technologies. With experience in
            Ruby/Rails, JavaScript, and React/Redux and a background in the disability field, I discovered web development through my
            own desire to create tools for use among my colleagues. I bring strong skills in communication and team-building that help
            organizations of all types, but especially non-profits, create the tools they need to support their employees in achieving their
            mission.
