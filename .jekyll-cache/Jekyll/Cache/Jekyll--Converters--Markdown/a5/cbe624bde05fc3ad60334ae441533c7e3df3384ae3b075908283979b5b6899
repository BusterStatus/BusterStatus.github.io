I"—<p>I have really come to enjoy working with Ruby over the past several months and learning more about widely used gems and libraries built with it.  I had wondered since the CLI project how Ruby was actually used to make a website because I didnâ€™t understand how the code I was writing could translate into some a user could see.  I started to see the value of SQL and how ActiveRecord allowed me to use it in conjunction with Ruby, but again, that was all happening behind the scenes.  As I got into Rack and saw how much goes into accessing a website and rendering its contents for the user, I was almost there.  Enter Sinatra and it finally all clicked.</p>
