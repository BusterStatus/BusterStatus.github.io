I"y<p>The past few weeks I have been working through lessons on Ruby, including the difference between procedural and object-oriented approaches.  So far, my web development experience includes working primarily with JavaScript, so the similarities between declaring variables and writing functions/methods helped with becoming acclimated to the language.  What I have appreciated about working with Ruby is the idea of using tests to help inform the correct way to write code.  I am sure other languages have ways of writing and using tests to determine whether code is working as intended, but I like what I see so far with Ruby.</p>
