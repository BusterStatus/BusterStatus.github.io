I"ö<p>I have been working to finish the Tic Tac Toe program and transition to building the scraping tool to wrap up the section on Object Oriented Ruby.  I have the Tic Tac Toe program passing all the tests, but I am trying to improve the computerâ€™s ability to play the game to a level beyond outputting random integers to select available spaces on the game board.  I guess colloquially one would refer to the computer player as a form of artificial intelligence.  However, I have been trying to refrain from thinking about or using that term because it seems to have become a meme for lack of a better word to describe anything with a decision tree as AI, which, to me at least, has always seemed to carry a greater weight in terms of its significance.</p>
