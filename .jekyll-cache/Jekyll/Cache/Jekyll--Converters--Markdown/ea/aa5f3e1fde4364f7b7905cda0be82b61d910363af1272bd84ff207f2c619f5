I"ó<p>I have been growing more comfortable with using Ruby as I have continued working through the lessons on Object Orientation.  While difficult, I enjoy the challenge of using classes to solve problems I encountered while working through the Procedural lessons.  I feel like the concepts can be hard to grasp because they seem so abstract at first, but I also feel like I am increasing my general programming and problem-solving abilities enough where the labs do not necessarily seem daunting.</p>
