I"ð<p>For about as long as I have had an interest in computers and learning more about them, which is the better part of the past twenty years, I have also had an interest in Magic: The Gathering, arguably the worldâ€™s oldest and most well known collectible card game.  I have played Magic at casual and competitive levels for a long time and one of the best aspects of doing so is all of the events you can attend both locally and throughout the rest of the country and world for that matter.</p>
